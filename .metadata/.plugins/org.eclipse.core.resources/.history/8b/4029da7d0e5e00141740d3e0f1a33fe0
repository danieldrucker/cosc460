Lab 4 Code Walk

Walk thru 1: simpledb.Parser.main() and simpledb.Parser.start()

	simpledb.Parser.main() is the entry point for the SimpleDB system. It calls simpledb.Parser.start(). The latter performs three main actions:
		1) It populates the SimpleDB catalog from the catalog text file provided by the user as argument (Database.getCatalog().loadSchema(argv[0]);).
		2) For each table defined in the system catalog, it computes statistics over the data in the table by calling: TableStats.computeStatistics(), which then does: TableStats s = new TableStats(tableid, IOCOSTPERPAGE);
		3) It processes the statements submitted by the user (processNextStatement(new ByteArrayInputStream(statementBytes));)

Walk thru 2: simpledb.Parser.processNextStatement()

	This method takes in the user input and attempts to parse it as SQL, using
	the Zql parsing library.  This method handles bad user input, as well as valid SQL statements include INSERT, DELETE, and SELECT statements.  

	We focus on the SELECT statement which is handled by 
		handleQueryStatement((ZQuery)s)
	This returns a Query object, which is then executed by calling
		query.execute();

Walk thru 3: simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement()

	This method gets user input in the form of a ZQuery, and use that to create a LogicalPlan, which is a separate class. 
	You then optimize the LogicalPlan into a PhysicalPlan (which uses a DBIterator). It does this by calling .physicalPlan, 
	which calls the JoinOptimizer. It then sets this to the Query, and returns it.

Walk thru 4: simpledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan()

	1) This method receives a ZQuery, and makes a vector that allows you to move through the SQL statements. I then creates a new,
	empty, LogicalPlan, and sets its query to the one we received in the parameter. It then walks through the vectors FROM clauses,
	by using the .getFrom call, then attempts to get the table from the Database Catalog associated with that name. It then 
	adds the Scan node for each of the tables.
	2) It then goes on to get the WHERE clause by calling .getWhere(). If the clause is not null and not nested, processExpression
	is called. processExpression makes sure that AND & OR is not being called, then checks whether a join or filter node is to be 
	created, and creates it.
	3) The method will check for a GROUPBY field to see if there is at most one. Then, it will checks that the clause is not too complex.
	It then walks through the SELECT list and makes sure there are no subqueries and that the aggregates are applied to at most
	one field each. It also ensures that all non-aggregated fields are in the in GROUPBY clause.
	

	Note: this method is rather long and complex.  Your walk thru should focus
	on the high-level ideas.  Specifically, explain how SQL query is processed to construct the LogicalPlan.  
 
Walk thru 5: simpledb.LogicalPlan.physicalPlan()

	Your walk thru should explain how these data structures are used:
		- equivMap
		- filterSelectivities
		- statsMap
		- subplanMap
