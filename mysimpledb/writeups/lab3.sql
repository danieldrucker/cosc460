/* For each of the queries below, put your SQL in the place indicated by the comment.  
   Be sure to have all the requested columns in your answer, in the order they are 
   listed in the question - and be sure to sort things where the question requires 
   them to be sorted, and eliminate duplicates where the question requires that.   
   I will grade the assignment by running the queries on a test database and 
   eyeballing the SQL queries where necessary.  I won't grade on SQL style, but 
   we also won't give partial credit for any individual question - so you should be 
   confident that your query works. In particular, your output should match 
   the example output.
