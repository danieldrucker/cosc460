Lab 3: Exercise 1

1. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, and TupleIterator are the classes that implement
the DbIterator Interface.

2. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OderBy, and Project are the subclasses of the Operator class.

3. Select - yes(Filter). Project - yes. Join - yes. Cross product - no. union - no. intersection - no. difference - yes(Aggregate).

4. It can implement the DbIterator interface without a next or hasNext because Filter requires a DbIterator to be passed in as a parameter in the
constructor and that is used to iterate through tuples. It also has a predicate that filters or "selects" out tuples. Therefore a next and hasNext
is not needed because it is abstracted by the passing of the DbIterator as a parameter in the construction of the Filter. hasNext and next are both methods that are inherited from class simpled.Operator.

5. 
while (iterR.hasNext):
    tup = iterR.next
    if (tup matches predicate):
        return tup
return null

6.
list = []
while (iterR.hasNext):
    tupR = iterR.next
    while (iterS.hasNext):
        tupS = iterS.next
        if (tupR and tupS match join predicate):
            newTup = merge(tupR, tupS)
            list.append(newTup)
    iterS.rewind
return list

7.
if (t1 == null):
    if (iterR.hasNext):
        t1 = iterR.next
while (t1 != null):
    while (iterS.hasNext):
        t2 = iterS.next
        if (t1 and t2 match join predicate):
            newTup = merge(t1, t2)
            return newTup
    
    iterS.rewind
    if (iterR.hasNext):
        t1 = iterR.next
    else:
        t1 = null

return null
